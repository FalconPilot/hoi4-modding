Its 45mm cannon can prove devastating against enemy armored targets, and its thick armor makes it resistant to most beatings. The tradeoff, however, comes in a very high fuel consumption and a very slow apparel, even slower than a horse."

Its firepower is sufficient to pierce pretty much any armored target from its time, but it also ends up being an extremely specialized and expensive tank."
