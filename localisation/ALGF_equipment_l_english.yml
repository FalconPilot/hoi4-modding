  ALG_infantry_equipment_0: "Ali B1"
  ALG_infantry_equipment_0_short: "Ali B1"
  ALG_infantry_equipment_0_desc: "The Ali B1 was a rifle developed in French Algeria before the Great War. Rugged and simple, it was massively fielded and met a great success during the war of independence."
  ALG_infantry_equipment_1: "F1 Fatma"
  ALG_infantry_equipment_1_short: "F1 Fatma"
  ALG_infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Algeria needed a replacement for the reliable but aging Ali B1. The semi-automatic F1 Fatma was created to modernize infantry divisions and was to become a standard rifle for land units."
  ALG_infantry_equipment_2: "Qua 8.5mm"
  ALG_infantry_equipment_2_short: "Qua 8.5mm"

  ALG_gw_tank_equipment: "Renault FT-17"
  ALG_gw_tank_equipment_short: "FT-17"
  ALG_gw_tank_equipment_desc: "Before the war of independence, Algeria didn't have a dedicated tank. All that was available were some Renault FT-17 that were \"borrowed\" to the french. While a great machine for its time, it now is a piece of history."
  ALG_light_tank_equipment_1: "M200 Muharib"
  ALG_light_tank_equipment_1_short: "M200"
  ALG_light_tank_equipment_1_desc: "The first algerian-developed tank is the M200 Muharib, a small and light recon tank that was used to a good extent at the very end of the war of independence. It's very simple and cheap, but also kinda lacks firepower, as it only sports a single 20mm main cannon."
  ALG_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_1: "M201 Matarid"
  ALG_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short: "M201"
  ALG_light_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc: "Created to counter the slightly more modern french tanks, the M201 Matarid carries a larger gun than its base model. Instead of a turret with a 20mm main gun, it sports a fixed 50mm gun that packs a whole lot more of punch against armored targets."
  ALG_light_tank_aa_equipment_1: "M202 Iibra"
  ALG_light_tank_aa_equipment_1_short: "M202"
  ALG_light_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc: "The french aviation was a big threat to Algerian rebels during the war of independence. The best counter to that would be the M202 Iibra, which is basically a M200 Muharib with its turret replaced by a slightly slanted turret fitted with two 12.7mm cannons."
  ALG_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1: "M203 Jamus"
  ALG_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short: "M203"
  ALG_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc: "The M200 chassis proved to be pretty polyvalent, and fitting it with a bigger, fixed turret with a 75mm howitzer ends up being a very good idea to design a dangerous weapon against infantry."
  ALG_light_tank_equipment_2: "M300 Faris"
  ALG_light_tank_equipment_2_short: "M300"
  ALG_light_tank_equipment_2_desc: "While the M200 chassis met some success on the battlefield, it also was extremely light and ultimately lacked firepower. To avoid sacrificing mobility, a slightly bigger chassis with a much better engine was designed : the M300 Faris. Sporting a 37mm main cannon and a roof-mounted 10mm machinegun, this tank promises way better performances than its predecessor."

  ALG_heavy_tank_equipment_1: "BT Turad"
  ALG_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short: "Turad"
  ALG_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc: "The french B1 tank was one of the sturdiest of its time, and so the Turad was developed to try and steal that title. Its 45mm cannon can prove devastating against enemy armored targets, and its thick armor makes it resistant to most beatings. The tradeoff, however, comes in a very high fuel consumption and a very slow apparel, even slower than a horse."
  ALG_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1: "BT Altarrad Althaqil"
  ALG_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short: "BT-AA"
  ALG_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc: "This variant of the Turad trades the turret, its 45mm main gun and one of its 10mm machinegun for a massive and frightening 75mm cannon fixed on the hull. Its firepower is sufficient to pierce pretty much any armored target from its time, but it also ends up being an extremely specialized and expensive tank."
